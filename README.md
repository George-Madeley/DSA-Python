# PythonUtils

This Repo is following the codecademy "Interview Practice Python" Course.

In this repo, I will be creating amny linear and complex data structures along with different corting and searching algorithms that i can later apply to other python based projects.

## Updates

### v1.1.7

- Added Docstring to LinkedList.py
- Added data types to LinkedList.py
- LinkedList class now uses the improved Node class instead of its own.

### v1.1.6

- Added Docstring to Node.py.
- Added data types to Node.py.
- Improved Node.py Class.

### v1.1.5

- Created a Binary Search Class and implimented `FindIndexOfValue()`. It is based off of the Codecademy design.

### v1.1.4

- Created a Search Algorithms Directory
- Created a Linear Search Class and implimented `FindIndexOfValue()`, `FindIndexesOfValue()`, `FindMaximum()`, and `FindMinimum()`. These are based off of the Codecademy design but have been altered to suit a class based structure.

### v1.1.3

- Redesigned Double Linked List to use own code and design. This is still loosly based off of Codecademy but using my own code instead of direct copy.
- Changed ToString() and Stringify() methods to use magic methods `__str__()`

### v1.1.2

- Added a Doubly Linked List (based off of Codecademy, rework required)
- Recordered project directory structure

### v1.1.1

Started the Linear Data Structures aspect.

- Added a Linked List

### v1.0.1

Added a Node class as a foundation for the ohter data structures.
